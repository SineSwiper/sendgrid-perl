       This module allows for easy integration with the SendGrid email
       distribution service and its SMTP API. It allows you to build up the
       pieces that make the email itself, and then pass this object to the
       Mail::SendGrid::Transport class that you wish to use for final
       delivery.

   CCrreeaattiioonn
       _n_e_w_[_A_R_G_S_]

       This creates the object and optionally populates some of the data
       fields. Available fields are:

       from
           The From address to use in the email

             from => 'Your Name <you@yourcompany.com>'

       to  Either a string or ARRAYREF containing the addresses to send to

             to => 'Your Customer <them@theircompany.com>, Another Customer <someone@somewhereelse.com>'

             to => [ them@theircompany.com, someone@somewhereelse.com ]

       cc  Adds additional recipients for the email and sets the CC field of
           the email

       bcc Adds additional recipients whose addresses will not appear in the
           headers of the email

       subject
           Sets the subject for the message

       date
           Sets the date header for the message. If this is not specified, the
           current date will be used

       message-id
           Sets the message id header. If this is not specified, one will be
           randomly generated

       encoding
           Sets the encoding for the email. Options are 7bit, base64, binary,
           and quoted-printable.  Quoted printable is the default encoding

       charset
           Sets the default character set. iso-8859-1 (latin1) is the default
           If you will be using wide characters, it is expected that the
           strings passed in will already be encoded with this charset

       text
           Sets the data for the plain text portion of the email

       html
           Sets the data for the html portion of the email

       Returns / sets a parameter for this message. Parameters are the same as
       those in the new method

       _a_d_d_A_t_t_a_c_h_m_e_n_t_(_D_A_T_A_, _[_O_P_T_I_O_N_S_]_)

       Specifies an attachment for the email. This can either be the data for
       the attachment, or a file to attach

       While the underlying MIME::Entity that will be created will try to
       determine the best encoding and MIME type, you can also specify it in
       the options

         $sg->addAttachment('/tmp/my.pdf',
                             type => 'application/pdf',
                             encoding => 'base64');

       This class contains a number of methods for working with the SMTP API.
       The SMTP API allows for customization of SendGrid filters on an
       individual basis for emails. For more information about the api, please
       visit http://wiki.sendgrid.com/doku.php?id=smtp_api

       _h_e_a_d_e_r

       Returns a reference to the Mail::SendGrid::Header object used to
       communicate with the SMTP API. Useful if you want to set unique
       identifiers or use the mail merge functionality

       _e_n_a_b_l_e_G_r_a_v_a_t_a_r

       _d_i_s_a_b_l_e_G_r_a_v_a_t_a_r

       Enable / disable the addition of a gravatar in the email

       _e_n_a_b_l_e_C_l_i_c_k_T_r_a_c_k_i_n_g

       Enables / disables click tracking for emails. By default this will only
       enable click tracking for the html portion of emails. If you want to
       also do click tracking on plain text, you can use the addition prameter
       'text'
         $sg->enableClickTracking( text => 1 );

       _e_n_a_b_l_e_U_n_s_u_b_s_c_r_i_b_e

       _d_i_s_a_b_l_e_U_n_s_u_b_s_c_r_i_b_e

       Enables / disables the addition of subscription management headers /
       links in the email.

       If no arguments are specified for enable, only a list-unsubscribe
       header will be added to the email. Additional parameters are:

       text
           The string to be added to the plain text portion of the email. This
           must contain the string <% %>, which is where the link will be
           placed

       html
           The string to be added to the html portion of the email. This must
           contain a tag with the format "<% link text %>", which will be
           replaced with the link

       replace
           A string inside of the email body to replace with the unsubscribe
           link. If this tag is not found in the body of the email, then the
           appropriate text or html setting will be used. If none of these are
           found, a link will not be inserted

             $sg->enableUnsubscribe( text => 'Unsubscribe here: <% %>',
                                     html => 'Unsubscribe <% here %>',
                                     replace => 'MyUnsubscribeTag' );

       such as a forum

       Parameters are:

       score
           Spam Assassin score at which point the email will be flagged as

       Enables / disables Domain Keys signatures for the message.

       Domain Keys is a digitial signature method, primarily used by Yahoo.

       Parameters are:

       domain
           The domain to sign the messages as. This domain must be set up with
           the proper DNS records, which can be found when going through the
           whitelabel wizard

       sender
           Sets if SendGrid will add a Sender header if the From email address
           does not match the specified domain. This allows for messages to
           still have a valid DomainKeys signature if the email address in the
           From field does not have whitelabeling set up, however it means
           that some email clients will display the message as "on behalf of"
           the From address

       _e_n_a_b_l_e_T_e_m_p_l_a_t_e

       _d_i_s_a_b_l_e_T_e_m_p_l_a_t_e

       Enables / disables the insertion of an email template. If you are
       enabling a template, you must specify the text of it in the html
       parameter. This text must contain the string "<% %>", which will be
       replaced with the body of the message

       _e_n_a_b_l_e_T_w_i_t_t_e_r

       Allows you to set twitter username / password information for this
       email.  The Twitter filter can be used to send either status updates or
       direct messages, based on the recipient email address

         my $sg = Mail::SendGrid->new( to => 'sendgrid@twitter', text => "My update" );

         $sg->enableTwitter( username => 'myusername', password => 'mypassword' );

       _e_n_a_b_l_e_B_c_c

       _d_i_s_a_b_l_e_B_c_c

       Enables / disables the automatic blind carbon copy of the email to a
       specific email address. While it makes little sense to enable a bcc
       here, versus adding it as a Bcc with the methods discussed previously,
       you can specify an email paramter which is the address to send to

       _e_n_a_b_l_e_B_y_p_a_s_s_L_i_s_t_M_a_n_a_g_e_m_e_n_t

       Allows you to specify that this email should not be suppressed for any
       reason, including the address appearing on the bounce, unsubscribe, or
       spam report suppression lists. This is useful for urgent emails, such
       as password reset notifications, that should always be attempted for
       delivery.

   TTrraannssppoorrtt mmeetthhooddss
       If you don't want to use one of the Mail::SendGrid::Transport classes,
       or want to build your own, these methods are used to get the data for
       transport

       _c_r_e_a_t_e_M_i_m_e_M_e_s_s_a_g_e

       Returns a MIME::Entity for the email

       _g_e_t_M_a_i_l_F_r_o_m

       Returns the address to be used in the MAIL FROM portion of the SMTP
       protocol

       _g_e_t_R_e_c_i_p_i_e_n_t_s

       Returns an array of the recipient address for the email, to be used in
       the RCPT TO portion of the SMTP protocol
